            eyecatch: 'On February 23rd, archaeologists were shocked to uncover a new fossil at a long-excavated site.',
            body: 'Meteor Falls is known for its beautiful waterfalls made of a stardust-like powder, but its better known in the scientific community for its rich geologic history and volcanic activity.  Not too long ago teams were researching seismic activity at the falls, and researchers commonly use meteor fragments found there in their investigation on Clefairy, a Pokemon theorized to come from space.  A new team of researchers made the trip out with the same intent, but during their dig they discovered a small pocket uncovered by the meteorite they unearthed.  Taking a deeper look inside, they found a small, complete Pokemon fossil hiding.  Unable to immediately identify the fossil, Prof. Rowan took ti back to the labs for further investigation. <br/><br/> "We haven\'t quite figured it out yet," says Prof. Rowan. "We may be looking at a completely new species of Pokemon!" Prof. Rowan\'s aides say that identification could take another few weeks before they can confirm what kind of fossil is in their hands. Prof. Rowan\'s research facility has previously done work similar to this, though the professor is considering bringing in Hoenn\'s very own Steven Stone as an advisor.  "Mr. Stone is a local to the area, and is quite involved in Hoenn\'s geologic study.  I feel he would be a valuable resource," Prof. Rowan commented.  When we reached out to Mr. Stone, he declined to interview with us, but expressed his excitement about being involved in this process.'

            body: 'Ever since legendary sightings within the Crown Tundra surged in the last few months, trainers have been itching to get out and explore the frozen snowlands. The region, previously locked off for all except climbers, researchers, and ace trainers, is a tantalizing new opportunity for trainers to catch rare Pokemon not commonly seen in Galar.  <br/><br/>In addition to a new slew of Pokemon, the region has become famous for recurring sightings of legendary and mythic Pokemon, a sight that has been considered incredibly rare for many generations. Many are itching to try and catch a glimpse of one of these one-of-a-kind Pokemon, including a young trainer named Joey.  "I\'ve gotta get out there with my Ratatta! Maybe I can find an ice-type Pokemon!" Other professional trainers have something a little more daunting in mind, however: catching one of these powerful creatures.  There are many who oppose the capturing of such Pokemon, especially as some are represented in religious cultures within the regions, as well as due to the concern that these powerful Pokemon could be used for crime.  Time will tell if any of these trainers will be able to even find any of these behemoth Pokemon, but if they do, the Littleroot Inquirer will be there for an exclusive interview!'

            body: 'You and I have both come across this scenario: you have a beautiful Milotic.  It\'s huge, knows some strong moves, and it has excellent stats... but it has a terrible nature. While that might be fine for your usual trainer, us breeders would immediately search out a suitable mate for our Pokemon to attempt to breed an absolutely perfect Milotic--be it for personal use, ego, or commission from high-rolling collectors.  But we have no suitable Pokemon that can effectively match with this prima Milotic, no time to raise up an agreeable partner, and we certainly hate having to find and catch Feebas. An ethical breeder would stop there, or turn back to one of those time-consuming methods to give Milotic its maritime lover dream, but instead the majority of us look elsewhere to simpler, more gelatinous pastures.  I, of course, speak of the cur of high-pedigree breeding: Ditto.  That purple amorphous Pokemon that can take the form of any pokemon is the go-to easy pass for many breeders; almost no Pokemon can resist the siren call of a ready Ditto, except, notably, Ditto.<br/><br/>As breeders, what are we really saying when we introduce this menace to our Pokemon\'s family trees? We barely know what Ditto is, after all--a prevailing theory is that these cupless jello blobs are in fact science experiments from the 90\'s! Can you in good conscience force this violet mold on your precious Pokemon, knowing it is naught but a test-tube escapee? Or what of the genetics of the matter--we all know that for healthy progeny to occur, both parents must be genetically diverse enough to provide unique material to the child... but Ditto\'s ability is to <i>perfectly</i> copy the Pokemon it faces.  What kind of bastardized clones are we birthing? Already we can see the affects of this breeding shortcut... <br/><br/>We must protect the sanctity of the art of Pokemon breeding!  I implore you, the next time you are tempted to take the easy route and fall for this squamous devil\'s offer, remember your Pokemon!  Remember scientific genetic principles!  Remember the children!!'

            eyecatch: 'Unova is famous for its big, bright, and loud championship competitions that can draw crowds from every region.',
            body: 'This year is no different as the region has once again geared up to present a trainer challenge to impress every spectator.  With the Galar region\'s rise to fame in recent years due to its engaging, sports-style arena and matchmaking system for prospective trainers to fight in, Unova has felt more pressure than ever to truly impress the crowds. Championships are great opportunities to show off a region\'s highlights and celebrity trainers, as well as draw in a huge amount of tourism from other regions. It\'s a chance not only for upcoming trainers to make a name for themselves, but also the region itself to make an impression.  However, this year things are quite different than normal, due to the ongoing concern over the Pokerus outbreak.<br/><br/>Back in May of last year, Unova officially announced a critical warning about a new strain of the Pokemon Virus that had somehow made the jump from Pokemon to human.  While usually Pokerus is a benefit for Pokemon, acting almost like a steroid in its effects, the newly documented Pokerus-HMN causes a long-lasting sickness in humans that can cause serious damage. Soon after, Unova began a strict regimen of city lockdowns, health checks, and general awareness to keep infection rates low, but Pokerus-HMN was too rapidly spreading and got through many of these quick measures.<br/><br/>Now, Unova has a strong enough hold on procedures to limit spread that Championship officials are confident in allowing a strictly-monitored version of the championship cup to be held. "To keep everyone safe during this time, only competitors, their pokemon, and match officials can be present in a Pokemon stadium," says Julius Whip, one of Unova\'s current medical leads on the pandemic. "We highly encourage everyone to tune in from the safety of their own homes, however! The Health and Championship Departments have worked closely to prepare a championship that will still bring all the excitement of a normal competition."  The Littleroot Inquirer was also requested to pass on the encouragement "to check out the online merch sales for Unova Champ Cup 21."'

            eyecatch: 'Did you notice that Pokemon eggs are all unique?',
            body: 'Not in the obvious way, of course.  Yes, it is very easy to see that Pokemon eggs all carry distinct patterns that indicate what species is waiting inside, and that these patterns are incredibly unique when compared to the eggs of other species.  But did you notice any small inconsistencies within the same species\' patterns themselves?  If you hadn\'t, don\'t feel too bad.  After thousands of years and observations on eggs, Prof. Oak has finally cumulated a measurable relationship between tiny, almost microscopic differences in pattern shape, placement, and size with the resulting Pokemon\'s nature.<br/><br/>"It\'s quite an interesting discovery," he says. "While it is difficult to witness without scientific apparatus, there are indeed small discrepencies on every Pokemon egg. Now, until we have a larger sample size to confirm our findings, I cannot say anything concrete, but I am quite confident in this theory." The professor then does on to add, "This could mean that breeders would have advance knowledge of their Pokemon in advance. While it does not mean much in the end--mints are, after all, a state-of-the-art medicine to change your Pokemon\'s nature and are easily accessible, we could use this for further research to see if there may be links to things such as Pokemon gender or ability as well." At the current moment, this research has not been published for the public, but we can expect to see an official publication in the coming year, if all goes well.'
