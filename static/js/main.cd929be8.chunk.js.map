With the Galar region\\'s rise to fame in recent years due to its engaging, sports-style arena and matchmaking system for prospective trainers to fight in, Unova has felt more pressure than ever to truly impress the crowds. Championships are great opportunities to show off a region\\'s highlights and celebrity trainers, as well as draw in a huge amount of tourism from other regions. It\\'s a chance not only for upcoming trainers to make a name for themselves, but also the region itself to make an impression.  However, this year things are quite different than normal, due to the ongoing concern over the Pokerus outbreak.<br/><br/>Back in May of last year, Unova officially announced a critical warning about a new strain of the Pokemon Virus that had somehow made the jump from Pokemon to human.  While usually Pokerus is a benefit for Pokemon, acting almost like a steroid in its effects, the newly documented Pokerus-HMN causes a long-lasting sickness in humans that can cause serious damage. Soon after, Unova began a strict regimen of city lockdowns, health checks, and general awareness to keep infection rates low, but Pokerus-HMN was too rapidly spreading and got through many of these quick measures.<br/><br/>Now, Unova has a strong enough hold on procedures to limit spread that Championship officials are confident in allowing a strictly-monitored version of the championship cup to be held. \"To keep everyone safe during this time, only competitors, their pokemon, and match officials can be present in a Pokemon stadium,\" says Julius Whip, one of Unova\\'s current medical leads on the pandemic. \"We highly encourage everyone to tune in from the safety of their own homes, however! The Health and Championship Departments have worked closely to prepare a championship that will still bring all the excitement of a normal competition.\"  The Littleroot Inquirer was also requested to pass on the encouragement \"to check out the online merch sales for Unova Champ Cup 21.\"'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            id: '192',\r\n            headline: 'Renowned Pokemon Researcher Finds Secret in Pokemon Egg Patterns',\r\n            tagline: 'Professor Oak, an expert in Pokemon, says that this small detail on placement of pattern could change breeding forever',\r\n            genre: ['Science','Breeding'],\r\n            author: 'Lief Greene',\r\n            date: 'January 7th, 2021',\r\n            storyImg: 'https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2018/articles/2018-11-15-11-56/pokemon-go-eggs-chart-hatching-2km-5km-7km-10km-eggs-1542282967178.jpg/EG11/thumbnail/750x422/format/jpg/quality/60',\r\n            eyecatch: 'Did you notice that Pokemon eggs are all unique?',\r\n            body: 'Not in the obvious way, of course.

After thousands of years and observations on eggs, Prof. Oak has finally cumulated a measurable relationship between tiny, almost microscopic differences in pattern shape, placement, and size with the resulting Pokemon\\'s nature.<br/><br/>\"It\\'s quite an interesting discovery,\" he says. \"While it is difficult to witness without scientific apparatus, there are indeed small discrepencies on every Pokemon egg. Now, until we have a larger sample size to confirm our findings, I cannot say anything concrete, but I am quite confident in this theory.\" The professor then does on to add, \"This could mean that breeders would have advance knowledge of their Pokemon in advance. While it does not mean much in the end--mints are, after all, a state-of-the-art medicine to change your Pokemon\\'s nature and are easily accessible, we could use this for further research to see if there may be links to things such as Pokemon gender or ability as well.\" At the current moment, this research has not been published for the public, but we can expect to see an official publication in the coming year, if all goes well.'\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    affiliates: [\r\n        {name:'Bulbapedia', link:'https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page', desc:'Bulbapedia is an encyclopedia about Pokémon to which anyone can contribute.'},\r\n        {name:'Serebii', link:'https://serebii.net/', desc:'Stay up to date on Pokemon news of all kinds.
