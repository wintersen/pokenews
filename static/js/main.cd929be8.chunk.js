A new team of researchers made the trip out with the same intent, but during their dig they discovered a small pocket uncovered by the meteorite they unearthed.  Taking a deeper look inside, they found a small, complete Pokemon fossil hiding.

"We may be looking at a completely new species of Pokemon!" Prof. Rowan\'s aides say that identification could take another few weeks before they can confirm what kind of fossil is in their hands.

But we have no suitable Pokemon that can effectively match with this prima Milotic, no time to raise up an agreeable partner, and we certainly hate having to find and catch Feebas.

With the Galar region\'s rise to fame in recent years due to its engaging, sports-style arena and matchmaking system for prospective trainers to fight in, Unova has felt more pressure than ever to truly impress the crowds. Championships are great opportunities to show off a region\'s highlights and celebrity trainers, as well as draw in a huge amount of tourism from other regions. It\'s a chance not only for upcoming trainers to make a name for themselves, but also the region itself to make an impression.  However, this year things are quite different than normal, due to the ongoing concern over the Pokerus outbreak.<br/><br/>Back in May of last year, Unova officially announced a critical warning about a new strain of the Pokemon Virus that had somehow made the jump from Pokemon to human.  While usually Pokerus is a benefit for Pokemon, acting almost like a steroid in its effects, the newly documented Pokerus-HMN causes a long-lasting sickness in humans that can cause serious damage. Soon after, Unova began a strict regimen of city lockdowns, health checks, and general awareness to keep infection rates low, but Pokerus-HMN was too rapidly spreading and got through many of these quick measures.<br/><br/>Now, Unova has a strong enough hold on procedures to limit spread that Championship officials are confident in allowing a strictly-monitored version of the championship cup to be held. "To keep everyone safe during this time, only competitors, their pokemon, and match officials can be present in a Pokemon stadium," says Julius Whip, one of Unova\'s current medical leads on the pandemic. "We highly encourage everyone to tune in from the safety of their own homes, however! The Health and Championship Departments have worked closely to prepare a championship that will still bring all the excitement of a normal competition."

After thousands of years and observations on eggs, Prof. Oak has finally cumulated a measurable relationship between tiny, almost microscopic differences in pattern shape, placement, and size with the resulting Pokemon's nature.<br/><br/>\"It's quite an interesting discovery,\" he says. \"While it is difficult to witness without scientific apparatus, there are indeed small discrepencies on every Pokemon egg.
